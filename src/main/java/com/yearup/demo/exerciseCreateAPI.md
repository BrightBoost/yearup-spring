## Mini Project

We are going to connect to the Northwind database, and focus on the supplier table.

In the API you'll add endpoints for:
- Get all the suppliers
- Add a new supplier
- Delete one of your newly added suppliers (old ones will give trouble because they are used in other tables)
- Get a supplier by id
- Modify an existing supplier
- Get a supplier by name
- Get all the suppliers by country
